TechSupport Inc. was founded in 2012 with the vision of simplifying IT support for individuals and small businesses. Over the years, we’ve expanded our services to include on-site repair, managed IT solutions, and remote diagnostics.

We pride ourselves on offering fast, reliable, and expert-level technical help for a wide range of consumer and business technologies. From fixing a broken laptop to setting up secure corporate networks, we cover it all.

Our team consists of over 500 certified technicians and support specialists. We handle more than 100,000 customer issues every year, with an average resolution time of under 30 minutes.

In 2024, we launched our SmartCare platform — a unified dashboard that lets users monitor device health, access support, and manage subscriptions all in one place.

We currently operate in the US, Canada, and the UK, with plans to expand into Asia and Europe by 2026.

Sustainability and privacy are central to our mission. All our data centers are powered by renewable energy, and we follow strict GDPR and CCPA-compliant data handling practices.
